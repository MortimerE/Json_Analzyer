This will read a json object in a txt file and compare it to a dictionary of terms and measurement units.
It will return the number of valid terms, the number of invalid terms, the invalid terms,
and the terms that are valid but have an invalid unit.

Upload the dictionary by putting it into a csv and giving the filepath to the program at init.

Put your json files in a directory and point the program to the folder,
then you should be able to print any report!
